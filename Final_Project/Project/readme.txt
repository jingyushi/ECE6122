1. The program runs on windows operating system.

2. Use Visual Studio to compile. I am using Visual Studio 2019 16.0.29806.167.

3. C++ V14.20 MFC for v142 is needed. If you don't have one, run Visual Studio Installer and modify your current Visual Studio. Select single component tab and install it.

4. The project configurations should be already done in the Project.sln. Just run it. Make sure the map file "pacman.map" is at the same directory with your .exe.
